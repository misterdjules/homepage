"Algorithms and Complexity", written by Herbert S. Wilf, is one of the best introduction ever written on the subject of algorithms analysis and complexity. With a total of 219 pages including the index, it is a short book, but it almost doesn't miss anything. Its brievity is actually one of its numerous achievements, and one that sets it aside from the rest of the litterature on this topic. It allows you to read it from cover to cover multiple times and really understand the matter while being encouraged by your quick progress. It is during my third reading that I decided to write this review.

I got a hardcover copy of the second edition, which includes solutions to most exercises that you will find at the end of each section. The first edition, without solutions to exercises, [is available to download free of charge](http://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/AlgoComp.pdf). The content between the first and second edition hasn't changed significantly. Although I have lately tried to avoid getting hard copies of books (for lack of room on my shelves), I must say that this edition is solid and is very pleasant to read. 

The book starts with an interesting short introduction that really gives you a bird's eye view of what the book is about. Hopefully, it will peak your curiosity as it peaked mine. Not that anything ground breaking or mysterious is presented in these couple of pages, but the way it is exposed was definitely unique to me. It's also your first chance to appreciate the very precise, concise yet humorous style of its author. Next is the first chapter of the book, called "Mathematical Preliminaries", that I suggest (as the book will too) you to skip: it presents a lot of relevant ideas and concepts, but it is more a reference for mathematical tools used throughout the book than a part of the journey.

The second chapter, "Recursive Algorithms", despite the content of its first section, should not be mistaken for an introduction to recursion. It is a chapter about the analysis of some important and typical recursive algorithms. If you're looking for an introduction to recursion, one of my favorites can be found in Steven S. Skiena's "The algorithm design manual". It explicitely establishes a relationship between recursion and mathematical induction, and it explains with great details and diagrams the idea of recursive data structures. 
This second chapter shows the systematic and methodological approach that will be used by the author throughout the book: presenting how a base algorithm capable of solving a given problem works, analyze it, show its weaknesses (in terms of complexity), present a more advanced algorithm solving the same problem but with better characteristics regarding complexity, and so on.
