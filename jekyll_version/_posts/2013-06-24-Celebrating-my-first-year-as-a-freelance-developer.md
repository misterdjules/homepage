One year ago, I left my full-time job at Ubisoft and embarked on a journey to become a freelance developer. In this article, I share my experience and a few concrete tips that may help you start yours. This article is, of course, targeted towards aspiring freelance programmers, but other freelance workers will hopefully also find a lot to learn and to relate to.

= The motivation, or why I wanted to work as a freelance developer =

The question of working as a freelance or permanent developer had not been an issue until very late in my career. I have been a software programmer for nine years now and before becoming a freelance developer last year, I had always worked as a full-time permanent employee. Until then, I had been happy as a permanent employee and today, most permanent software developers I meet are also very happy. 

So what did lead me to question my permanent status and to consider becoming a freelance developer? 

== A bit of context ==

My latest full-time experience was as a programmer at Ubisoft Montreal, a very big video games studio. The total number of employees at the time I started was around 1800, and it had grown to around 2300 at the time I left. I started as a generalist programmer but I quickly moved to a more specialized role: gameplay programmer.

Most of my time at Ubisoft was spent working on a very cool project: the Assassin's Creed series. It's a big video game franchise that has sold millions of copies since its first opus. I am a big fan of the series myself. The game is huge and absolutely stunning, full of historical references reproduced with great details and described in an in-game encyclopedia. 
The team was (and is still) very welcoming to new teammates, which made my integration very easy and enjoyable. 

The game's media coverage is very large and it's easy to read about the gamers' and critics' expectations about the game, sometimes about something you're working on right now in your code editor. In other words, there's a lot to be happy about as an employee, not to mention Ubisoft Montreal's great working environment and flexible working hours.

However in the long term and as a software developer however I felt that, after a few years, as my gameplay programmer skills sharpened continuously, my general software development skills were declining.

AAA games are usually made by a team of hundreds of people, of which several dozens are programmers. Most of the time, gameplay programmers are assigned to a very specific area of the code base, and can keep working on it for a few years. This can significantly reduce the diversity of the types of design and implementation challenges you have to face. 

Also, the code base is often huge, with a total of several millions lines of code and the workflow can be rather slow. At some point, it could take half an hour to link the game's executable on X-Box. More generally, the software developer tools 
on such a big productions can make your work very tedious and iterations very slow. It doesn't give a lot of room for experimenting and thus, self-improvement. 

Finally, most libraries, frameworks and tools that developers can use are developed in-house. This makes the skills acquired by programmers much less transferable to other companies, let alone to other sectors of the IT industry.

In other words, I had the feeling that I would get cornered in a very specific niche If I kept working for such a big company in a specialized role. It didn't seem like a reasonnable choice to me at the time, especially if you consider how concentrated the video games industry is: outside of Montreal and the United-States, video games studios were struggling with a slow economy, a lack of tax breaks and rising production costs.

Over the years, I developed 

- Big companies usually move slowly, technology moves fast.
- Desire to work as an artisan rather than as a factory worker.
- Working in small teams exposes you to more diverse challenges (design, implementation, devops).
- The power to set the value of your work, and other indirect consequences (no more overtime, no peer pressure and 
more direct negotiations).
- Ability to work on personal projects that may become business opportunities.

== Another point of view: the full-time intermittent developper == 
 
=== Advantages on being a "real" freelance developer ===

- insurance and health care.
- retirement plans.
- better support from your bank (even getting a credit card can be tough when you start as a freelance developper).

=== But to me it's not the real deal ===

- Overtime, peer pressure, negotiations are less direct.

= Preparation, or how to put the odds on your side =

- Saving money.
- Making contacts.
- Help your employer make your departure as painless as possible:
  - Several months notice.
  - Be flexible on the deadline.
- Make sure your skillset can be sold to potential clients and is well balanced: a mix of mainstream technologies (Java, JavaScript), and possibly some that are more "niche" (Lua, Kinect, etc.).
- Registering your tax numbers: it helps save some money when buying computer hardware.
- Getting the right hardware: laptop or desktop ? -> laptop for remote work + clients that don't provide you with a computer, apple or PC ? -> apple + virtual machines. Lots of ram for virtual machines (8 GBs).
- Putting your code online: GitHub or BitBucket? -> BitBucket for unlimited private repositories. Clients will want to see your code.

== What you don't actually need at first ==

- A website: recruiters and companies don't look for it, unless your a front-end web developer. 
- Incorporating your business. This is really useful if your revenue is greater than 100K dollars, otherwise it's too costly. 

= Transition, or what to do before you sign your first clients =

- Attending developer meetups and conferences.
- Networking with potential clients: AQII, MTLNewTech, MTL Tech Calendar.
- Sharpen your skillset by working on personal projects and code that you can publish. You should work only on code 
that you can publish online, or at least show to potential clients, otherwise it reduces its value significantly.
- Update your LinkedIn account and make it easy for recruiters to find you: make your title clear, actively connect with local recruitment companies, add your skills and describe your past experiences using easy to search keywords.

= Execution =

- Accounting solutions: Harvest vs Freshbooks: Harvest because it's cheaper and it's almost equivalent for beginners.
- Self training: safari books online + local conferences + blogs.
- Doing taxes yourself: less expensive, highly informative and easy.


= How did it work for me? =

== Achievements ==

- My income increased significantly.
- Worked on many diverse modern technologies: Lua, Node.js, SPDY, iOS.
- Worked on much smaller teams, and started many projects I worked on from scratch: lots of design and implementation challenges to learn from.
- Met with very interesting developers and business founders/managers: lots of inspiration for self improvement.

== What I'm looking for in the future ==

- Diversifying my revenue with personal projects: the question of when to accept or not accept a contracting opportunity.
- Diversifying my clients base, in Montreal and abroad.
