One year ago, I left my full-time job at Ubisoft and embarked on a journey to become a freelance developer. In this article, I share my experience and a few concrete tips that may help you start yours. This article is, of course, targeted towards aspiring freelance programmers, but other freelance workers will hopefully also find a lot to learn and to relate to.

= The motivation, or why I wanted to work as a freelance developer =

The question of working as a freelance or permanent developer had not been an issue until very late in my career. I have been a software programmer for nine years now and before becoming a freelance developer last year, I had always worked as a full-time permanent employee. Until then, I had been happy as a permanent employee and today, most permanent software developers I meet are also very happy. 

So what did lead me to question my permanent status and to consider becoming a freelance developer? 

== A bit of context: from AAA games to freelance developer ==

My latest full-time experience was as a programmer at Ubisoft Montreal, a very big video games studio. The total number of employees at the time I started was around 1800, and it had grown to around 2300 at the time I left. I started as a generalist programmer but I quickly moved to a more specialized role called "gameplay programmer" in the video games industry.

Most of my time at Ubisoft was spent working on a very cool project: the Assassin's Creed series. It's a big video game franchise that has sold millions of copies since its first opus. I am a big fan of the series myself. The game is huge and absolutely stunning, full of historical references reproduced with great details and described in an in-game encyclopedia. 
The team was (and is still) very welcoming to new teammates, which made my integration very easy and enjoyable. 

The game's media coverage is very large and it's easy to read about the gamers' and critics' expectations about the game, sometimes about something you're working on right now in your code editor. In other words, there's a lot to be happy about as an employee, not to mention Ubisoft Montreal's great working environment and flexible working hours.

However in the long term and as a software developer I felt that, after a few years, as my gameplay programmer skills sharpened continuously, my general software development skills were declining. There's a lot of different reasons for that, but I'm going to pick three of them that I think can apply to anyone in the industry.

First, AAA games are usually made by a team of hundreds of people, of which several dozens are programmers. Most of the time, gameplay programmers are assigned to a very specific area of the code base, and can keep working on it for a few years. This can significantly reduce the diversity of the types of design and implementation challenges you have to face. 

Also, the code base is often huge, with a total of several millions lines of code and the workflow can be rather slow. At some point, it could take half an hour to link the game's executable on X-Box. More generally, the software developer tools 
on such a big productions can make your work very tedious and iterations very slow. It doesn't give a lot of room for experimenting and thus, self-improvement. 

Finally, most libraries, frameworks and tools that developers can use are developed in-house for technical, legal and strategic reasons. This makes the skills acquired by programmers much less transferable to other companies, let alone to other sectors of the IT industry.

In other words, I had the feeling that I would get cornered in a very specific niche If I kept working for such a big company in a specialized role. It didn't seem like a reasonnable choice to me at the time, especially if you consider how concentrated the video games industry is: outside of Montreal and the United-States, video games studios were struggling with a slow economy, a lack of tax breaks and rising production costs. 

I was also witnessing the tremendous progress made by developers working in other sectors of the IT industry. It seemed that gameplay programmers were trying to solve the same problems as 15 years ago (pathfinding, collision avoidance, fun combat systems, etc.). On the other hand, I had the impression that progammers in other sectors of the IT industry were using modern tools, programming languages and best practices to solve new problems by experimenting quickly.

It was time to take a step back and determine how I could better match my professional goals with my day to day job.

== Identifying what's important in your career ==

In this section, I present a few key points that I identified as having the biggest impact on how I feel about my work. It is very personal and it could be very different from the way you feel about being a software developer. However, If you find yourself wondering where to push your software development career next, I encourage you to write down a short list of what impacts you most when working. It should give you at least a few clues about which working environment would best match your 
preferences. 

=== Big companies (sometimes) move slowly, technology moves fast ===

Once again, this really resonated with me after having spent 4 years in such a large studio as Ubisoft Montreal, and working in a very specific industry: video games development. Moreover, people who worked in other studios, or even in the same one on the same project as me, have different views about that.

My feeling is that big companies, for a lot of different reasons, tend not to use latest technological advances in software development to their advantage. The reasons are numerous, from too much politics and opiniotated technical managers to development cycles that are too long to allow for rapid changes in their technological stack.

To me, this leads to a degradation of developers' productivity, unpleasant workflows and ultimately, bad morale within developers teams. Additionally for individual developers, it leads to less relevant skillsets over time, and a decrease in value on the jobs market.

=== Work as an artisan rather than as a factory worker ===

Being part of a project where you need to focus only on your specific part of the code base has a lot of advantages, but it can also become very unstimulating, even depressing at times. Depending on your area of expertise, you can find yourself working in such an abstracted and isolated environment that you lose sight of the big picture of what software development is about. To me, this could be analoguous to working on a production line. At one point, the term "industry" in the "video games industry" started to make a lot of sense, and I felt like a production line worker wanting to leave the factory to become more of an artisan.

=== Working in small teams ===

This point is linked to the previous one, because it's more likely that you'll work within a large team if you work in a factory-like environment. I found that being part of a small team exposes you to more diverse challenges: software design, implementation details, operations and deployment, to name a few. It is very likely that, unless your position is at the crossroads of different teams and people, your responsibilities will be much less diverse in a large team.

Working on only one of these aspects of software development can be fun, but I find that working on all of them helps you build the big picture of what it takes to ship complex pieces of software. Of course, it's difficult to scale to several projects if you're involved in so many different areas for each one, which leads me to the next point.

=== Starting projects from scratch ===


=== The power to set the value of your work, and other indirect consequences (no more overtime, no peer pressure and 
more direct negotiations) ===

=== The ability to work on personal projects that may become business opportunities ===

== Another point of view: the full-time intermittent developper == 
 
=== Advantages on being a "real" freelance developer ===

- insurance and health care.
- retirement plans.
- better support from your bank (even getting a credit card can be tough when you start as a freelance developper).

=== But to me it's not the real deal ===

- Overtime, peer pressure, negotiations are less direct.

= Preparation, or how to put the odds on your side =

- Saving money.
- Making contacts.
- Help your employer make your departure as painless as possible:
  - Several months notice.
  - Be flexible on the deadline.
- Make sure your skillset can be sold to potential clients and is well balanced: a mix of mainstream technologies (Java, JavaScript), and possibly some that are more "niche" (Lua, Kinect, etc.).
- Registering your tax numbers: it helps save some money when buying computer hardware.
- Getting the right hardware: laptop or desktop ? -> laptop for remote work + clients that don't provide you with a computer, apple or PC ? -> apple + virtual machines. Lots of ram for virtual machines (8 GBs).
- Putting your code online: GitHub or BitBucket? -> BitBucket for unlimited private repositories. Clients will want to see your code.

== What you don't actually need at first ==

- A website: recruiters and companies don't look for it, unless your a front-end web developer. 
- Incorporating your business. This is really useful if your revenue is greater than 100K dollars, otherwise it's too costly. 

= Transition, or what to do before you sign your first clients =

- Attending developer meetups and conferences.
- Networking with potential clients: AQII, MTLNewTech, MTL Tech Calendar.
- Sharpen your skillset by working on personal projects and code that you can publish. You should work only on code 
that you can publish online, or at least show to potential clients, otherwise it reduces its value significantly.
- Update your LinkedIn account and make it easy for recruiters to find you: make your title clear, actively connect with local recruitment companies, add your skills and describe your past experiences using easy to search keywords.

= Execution =

- Accounting solutions: Harvest vs Freshbooks: Harvest because it's cheaper and it's almost equivalent for beginners.
- Self training: safari books online + local conferences + blogs.
- Doing taxes yourself: less expensive, highly informative and easy.


= How did it work for me? =

== Achievements ==

- My income increased significantly.
- Worked on many diverse modern technologies: Lua, Node.js, SPDY, iOS.
- Worked on much smaller teams, and started many projects I worked on from scratch: lots of design and implementation challenges to learn from.
- Met with very interesting developers and business founders/managers: lots of inspiration for self improvement.

== What I'm looking for in the future ==

- Diversifying my revenue with personal projects: the question of when to accept or not accept a contracting opportunity.
- Diversifying my clients base, in Montreal and abroad.
