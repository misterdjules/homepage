One year ago, I left my full-time job at Ubisoft Montreal and embarked on a journey to become a freelance developer. In this article, I share my experiences and a few concrete tips that may help you start yours. This article is, of course, targeted towards aspiring freelance programmers, but other freelance workers will hopefully also find a lot to learn and to relate to.

This article is composed of three sections. Each section covers a stage of your progress towards your goal of becoming a freelance developer. They are presented in a chronological order: first the preparation stage, then the transition between your previous occupation and freelancing, and finally the stage at which you're working on your first contracts.

A career is something very personal, and it is very likely that you have different views about what becoming a freelance developer means than mine. This document is not about answering all questions to everyone. It's about sharing my experience with other newcomers so that they can benefit from it, however they like. Any question or remark is more than welcome, please share them in the comments at the bottom of this page.

With that in mind, let's start your journey with the first stage: getting prepared to become a freelance developer.

Preparation, or how to put the odds on your side
================================================

It can seem very obvious, but it is very important to be well prepared. A good preparation will buy you more time so you don't have to 
find a client in your first few weeks. It will also allow you to fail a few times before generating a steady income. 
We will go through the topics that I find most important during your preparation, and we'll conclude by mentionning what you might think you need to do, but actually don't.

Building up your experience and profesionnal network with full-time jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This can seem contradictory to the purpose of this article but, to my opinion, spending some time at full-time positions is a great way to achieve three of the most important steps of your preparation: saving money, making contacts and choosing your skills. 

Working as a full-time or part-time employee generally gives you a steady income that can help you save money regularly. It also gives you access to two very valuable resources: real-world projects and co-workers. Real-world projects are great to sharpen and acquire skills. They also help you give a value to them. It will be important when you have to decide which skills you want to focus on. Co-workers are also a great source of knowledge, inspiration, and constitute the base of your professional network.

Acquiring significant real-world experience and building a substantial professional network takes time. I would suggest working at least for two different companies and spending a minimun of two years at each of them before making the move to freelancing. I had worked at four different companies for a total of nine years before embracing freelance development. To me it was the good timing, but others could thing it's too late or too early.

Saving money
------------

Saving money, by working full-time or by any other mean, is key. Once you start positioning yourself as a freelance developer, it could be a while before you sign your first contract. It usually takes even longer before you can cash-in your first check because of the delay between the moment your start working and the moment you receive some payment from your client. In this situation, it's not always easy to relax and focus on training, networking, finding clients or building your portfolio. I would recommend a buffer of one year: today, the demand for developers is high, and you should find your first contract pretty quickly if your skills are up to date. However, if you find that your offer is not in tune with the market, it could take a while before you get back on track. The amount of money you'll need to save will depend on your lifestyle. In Montreal, where the cost of living is low comparing to other major cities in North America, 15K$ is enough. It can be higher in other cities.

Making contacts
---------------

In the beginning, your direct professional network, like former co-workers, will bring you the mast majority of your contract opportunities. 
Some of them probably started their own business and are looking for a software developer. This is very frequent for instance in the videogames industry where senior employees often start their own indie game studio, but it also happens in other industries. They trust you and they had a pleasant experience when working with you, which sometimes is even more important than your skills. 

This can come in very handy when you're still in the process of defining your freelancer skills set and trying to acquire new skills. For instance, if you're very experienced in C++ development but have little experience in web development, this could be a good way to land a web development contract. This is why your previous work experience is very important: the more people you worked with, the more likely it is that you'll have someone in your direct professionnal network looking for someone they trust.

Using social networks like Linkedin, attending meetups and conferences is not necessary at this stage of your journey. Because you're not a 
freelance developer yet, people will have some difficulties understanding how you're positionning yourself. You probably don't even know yourself. Even if you were presented with contract opportunites, you would not be able to accept them. To me, at that point your time is best spent nurturing your relationships with your co-workers.

Playing nice with your employer 
----------------------------

In the same idea, I strongly advise that you help your employer make your departure as painless as possible. One way to do this would be to give your notice several months before you plan to actually leave, and to be flexible about the deadline. You want to avoid putting them in a difficult position. Usually, there's no hurry for you to leave, and staying a few weeks or months more than planned can help you save even more money. In the end, if your departure is smooth, senior employees working in your team and starting new businesses that need freelance developers will be more likely to reach out to you.
  
Choosing your skills
------------------------

When working in the same permanent position for a while, you're not always encouraged to adapt your skills to the market. In this case, being a specialist has a lot of value, especially if you're working in a big company where technical roles are very separated: the more you know about one or two subjects the better because you work more on less on the same tasks. Generalist working for small companies have an advantage here: they can choose from a broader set of skills. 

In both situations though, you will have to make a choice: you can't be very good at everything, and people hiring you to work as a contractor will want to see immediate results that are correlated to the amount of money they spend. Where employeers hiring you full-time may see some investment in paying you to work on something you don't know, your clients will want to see an immediate return on investment.

I suggest that you don't put your eggs in the same basket: choose a small set of skills that is well balanced between mainstream technologies and some more "niche" ones. By mainstream I mean generic skills like Java, JavaScript (front-end or back-end), databases (SQL and NoSQL), web development, .Net, Python, etc. I recommend that you pick these skills from your previous work experiences: because they are mainstream, the competition is larger than for other skills, and you will need several years of experience to be seen as a good investment by potential clients.

Niche skills on the other hand, do not necessarily require the same amount of experience because there's less competition. What do I mean by niche? Lua, graph databases, Chrome extensions development, Kinect programming, video games profiling and optimization, etc. If you're good at one of these skills, chances are that potential clients won't require you to have several years of experience because they won't be able to find someone with thise experience as easily as for more mainstream skills.

The type of contracts you'll get from mainstream and nice skills are usually very different: longer and less paying contracts for mainstream skills, shorter but high paying jobs for nice ones. Having a well balanced set will allow you to alternate between these types of contracts.
It will also protect you from technology shifts and rapid changes in demand for a given skills. Also not that a mainstream skill can become 
niche over time, COBOL programmers could probably tell you a few interesting stories on that.

To me, a well balanced set of skills is composed of two mainstream skills and one niche. Of course, the more the better, but staying up to date 
on more than three skills can ve very time consuming. My three mainstream skills are back-end web development with Node.js, iOS development annd C++. I also have two niche skills: Lua and advanced debugging of native applications.

Gearing up
----------

To me, a freelancer is like a craftman and a great craftman needs great tools. These come in two categories: hardware and software tools.
By definition, hardware is harder to change than software, so I will focus only on the former in this article.

Your clients will need you in their office most of the time. Chances are you'll also want to work at home sometimes. It's handy for instance when you have some paperwork to do during the day and need to go around town, but still need to get some work done. You may also want to work for remote clients. Finally, having the freedom to take a day off during the week and work during the week-end when your client's office are closed is also very nice. In other words, you'll need a laptop.

It's not easy to pick a good laptop if you want to leave your options open. You won't be able to develop iOS apps on something else than Apple hardware. This is very important since mobile apps development is a market of choice for freelance developers, and iOS is one of the largest players in this industry. If you don't focus on just one skill, what if you'd like to be able to work on iOS apps, develop video games or native applications running on Windows and that you like your Ubuntu setup for web development? In that case, a high-end mac book pro with lots of RAM and a SSD drive will allow you to host all virtual machines you need and run them reasonnably fast. 

For those not working on iOS applications, I would suggest that you think twice before buying a PC laptop: unless you're sure you don't want to target clients looking for iOS developers, chances are that these kind of projects will come around and it would be a shame to have to invest in another computer just to be able to work on Apple's platform.

If you choose to go the Apple way, I invite you to buy a light and small model: a 13 inches macbook pro is ideal to me. At around 4 pounds, it won't put too much strain on your back when carrying it in a back pack on your way to your client's office, or to your favorite café. It's also small enough to fit in small back packs. An ethernet is also a must: it can come very handy at offices where they still don't allow contractors to use their Wifi network.	

Don't be afraid to invest in good hardware, you'll be able to deduct hardware expenses from your income taxes, and you'll be able to get the sales tax back. A 13 inches macbook pro with retina display, 8GBs RAM and a 128 GBs SSD drive currently sells for 1699$, taxes not included.
If 128 GBs of storage is a little too tight to store all your data, I invite you to think about using an external USB 3 key before opting for the expensive SSD upgrade to 256 GBs. Anyway, for a maximum of 2000 dollars that you won't have to pay in taxes, you should be able to get a great tool that makes coding efficient and pleasurable.

Quick paperwork that can save you money
---------------------------------------

Paperwork can be very frustrating sometimes, but it can also save you a lot of money! One thing that is really easy to setup is registering your sales tax numbers. It provides you with two advantages:
- tax numbers on your invoices that make you look more professionnal.
- the ability to get a refund on some of the sales tax that you paid when buying goods that help you run your business (computers, software, etc.).

In other words, it can save you lots of money and prevents your clients to wonder if you're reaully serious about your business.

If you're a Québec resident, you can do it online and receive your tax numbers almost instantly. Go to the "business" section of Revenu Québec's website, then click on "GST/HST and QST". Look for "Registering for Revenu Québec Files" in the "Online services" box on the right.

Putting your code online
------------------------

Your code tells a lot about who you are as a programmer. Potential clients will want to see at least a few hundreds lines of your code
and you should be able to provide them with it very quickly. Of course, the more code you wrote is available publicly, unless you don't have the right to publish it, the better. 

GitHub and BitBucket are two great platforms when it comes to hosting code and publishing it. They are very similar technically speaking and in terms of basic user features, but their purpose is very different. While GitHub is really a social coding platform, I see BitBucket more as a business friendly code management service in the cloud.

GitHub allows you to have an unlimited number of collaborators, but [you have to pay for private repositories](https://github.com/plans). You can have 5 private repositories for 7$/month, 10 for 12$, 20 for 22$ and finally 50 for $50. With Bitbucket, while you can have an unlimited number of repositories (private or public), the [different available plans](https://bitbucket.org/plans) limit the number of people you can collaborate with on a given repository: from 5 collaborators for free to an unlimited number of collaborators for 200$.

Depending on the type of projects you work on, you might need more private repositories, or more collaborators. If you plan to work on open source projects, GitHub is really the platform of choice. On the other hand, if you plan to build proprietary software with a limited number of collaborators, and you need to host your code on the cloud, BitBucket is an excellent solution. Personnally, I use both of them: GitHub when I contribute to open source software, and BitBucket when I work on my personal projects.

What you don't actually need to do right now
--------------------------------------------

It is common for aspiring freelance developers, me included, to think that they absolutely need to have everything other businesses usually have before they can start getting contracts. Things like a good looking website or an incorporated company can indeed be very useful for established businesses, but it is not necessary for a freelance programmer who is just starting. Worse, it can even incur large additional costs, both in time and money, at a time when these resources can be very scarce.

Building and maintaining your website will take you time that you won't be able to spend on getting contracts. In my experience, potential clients don't really care if you have a good looking website, as long as your code can be found somewhere. For that purpose, there are better solutions than custom websites in the previous section "Putting your code online".

Incorporating your company will cost you money to register it, but also to unregister it. That can be a lot of money spent for nothing if you quickly realize you need to change your business strategy soon after you started. It will also take much more time in paperwork that you will have to offload to an accountant, which will also cost you money. In my opinion, you can spend at least a few years without incorporating your business by declaring yourself as self-employed. Unless you make more than 100K$/year, incorporating your business should not represent a big advantage.

You're now ready to move on to the next step of your journey as an aspiring freelance developer. But before doing so, let's summarize what we learned so far. 

To be well prepared for being a successful freelancer, you'll need to do the following:
- Spend a few years as a full-time employee and make contacts that trust your work and yourself.
- Save money while your employed so that you don't need land a contract in the first few weeks when you're a freelance developer.
- Leave your employer respectfully, giving her plenty of time to prepare your departure, that will help you keep a good relationship 
with your old employer and colleagues, which will help you in the mid/long term.
- Choose your skills, ideally two mainstream and one niche.
- Invest in the right hardware to be ready to tackle any challenge for the next three years. An high-end macbook pro is my recommendation.
- Do paperwork that can save you money, like registering your tax numbers, as soon as possible.
- Put your code online so that potential clients can actually see how good it is.

On the contrary, you should not take too much time to build a sofisticated website, and you should not incorporate your businness.

With all that in mind, let's move to the next stage of your journey: what to do after you left your full-time job and before you sign your first contracts.

Transition, or what to do before you sign your first clients
============================================================

Leverage social networks to announce your new status
----------------------------------------------------

Attending developer meetups and conferences
-------------------------------------------

Networking with potential clients: AQII, MTLNewTech, MTL Tech Calendar
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Sharpen your skillset by working on personal projects and code that you can publish. You should work only on code 
that you can publish online, or at least show to potential clients, otherwise it reduces its value significantly.
- Update your LinkedIn account and make it easy for recruiters to find you: make your title clear, actively connect with local recruitment companies, add your skills and describe your past experiences using easy to search keywords.

Execution, or how to keep your business on track
================================================

Pricing
-------

Accounting and invoicing solutions 
----------------------------------

Harvest vs Freshbooks : Harvest because it's cheaper and it's almost equivalent for beginners. Also mention other solutions https://www.waveapps.com/.

Training
--------

- Self training: safari books online + local conferences + blogs.

Taxes
-----

- Doing taxes yourself: less expensive, highly informative and easy.
- Keeping your expenses and tax records up to date at every transaction: helps a lot to make the process really smooth at the 
end of the quarter/year.
- Store receipts electronically on the cloud, take pictures of them using your phone.

Insurance 
---------

- Health and salary insurance: talk to independent providers like SFL.

Financial planning
------------------

Looking forward
