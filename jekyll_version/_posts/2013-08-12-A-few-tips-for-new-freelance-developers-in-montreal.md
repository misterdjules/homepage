One year ago, I left my full-time job at [Ubisoft Montreal](http://montreal.ubisoft.com/en) and became a freelance developer. In this article, I share my experiences and a few concrete tips on how to switch to freelancing. It is, of course, targeted towards aspiring freelance programmers, but other freelance workers will hopefully also find a lot to learn. Some of the information presented here is also specific to Montreal, but the overall step by step process can be applied elsewhere.

This article is composed of three sections. Each section covers a stage of your progress towards your goal of becoming a freelance developer. They are presented in a chronological order. First, we'll go through the preparation stage: before you leave your current position and can position yourself as a freelance developer. Then, the following stage we call "transition" will be presented. At that point, the switch to freelancing is done, but no contract has been signed yet. Finally, the "execution" stage will be introduced when you're working on your first contracts.

A career is something very personal, and it is very likely that people have different views about what becoming a freelance developer means. __This document is not about answering all questions to everyone. It's about sharing my experience with other newcomers so that they can benefit from it.__ Any question or remark is more than welcome, please share them in the comments at the bottom of this page.

You can also find some much more detailed information in the book entitled ["Le guide du travailleur autonome"](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7269128-le-guide-du-travailleur-autonome) written by Jean-Beno√Æt Nadeau. Unfortunately, I own a French edition and I don't know if an English one is available.

With that in mind, let's start with the first stage: getting prepared to become a freelance developer.

Preparation, or how to put the odds on your side
================================================

It can seem very obvious, but __it is very important to be well prepared__. A good preparation will buy you more time so you don't have to find a client in your first few weeks. It will also allow you to fail a few times before generating a steady income. 
We will go through the topics that I find most important during your preparation. We'll also conclude by mentionning what some developers think is necessary but can actually be armful.

Building up your experience and profesionnal network with full-time jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This can seem contradictory to the purpose of this article but __spending some time at full-time positions is a great way to achieve three of the most important steps of your preparation:__ saving money, making contacts and choosing your skills. 

Working as a full-time or part-time employee generally gives you a steady income that can help you save money regularly. __It also gives you access to two very valuable resources: real-world projects and experienced co-workers.__ Real-world projects are great to sharpen and acquire skills. They also help you give a price to them. It will be valuable when you have to decide which skills you want to focus on. Experienced colleagues are also a great source of knowledge, inspiration, and constitute a strong foundation for your professional network.

Acquiring significant real-world experience and building a substantial professional network takes time. I would suggest spending a minimum of four years working full-time for at least two different companies before making the move to freelancing. I had worked at four different companies for a total of nine years before doing so.

Saving money
------------

__Saving money is key.__ Once you start positioning yourself as a freelance developer, it could be a while before you sign your first contract. It usually takes even longer before you can cash-in your first check because of the delay between the moment your start working and when you receive your client's payment. In this situation, it's not always easy to relax and focus on training, networking, finding clients or building your portfolio. 

__I would recommend a buffer of one year:__ today, the demand for developers is high, and you should find your first contract pretty quickly if your skills are up to date. However, if you find that your offer is not in tune with the market, it could take a while before you get back on track. The amount of money you'll need to save will depend on your lifestyle. Evaluate your cost of living per month and determine how much you'll need for a full year. Don't underestimate your expenses: treating yourself when times are hard and you haven't signed your first client can prevent you from burning out.

Making contacts
---------------

In the beginning, __your direct professional network, like former co-workers, will bring you the mast majority of your contract opportunities.__ Some of them may have started their own business and are looking for a software developer. Their trust and their experience working with you is often as important as your skills. This is very frequent in Montreal's videogames industry where senior employees often start their own indie game studio, but it also happens in other industries. 

People who trust you not only for your technical skills will help you acquire new ones. Someone who had a very pleasant experience working with you will be more inclined to hire you to work on something you don't master. For instance, if you're very experienced in C++ programming but have little experience in web development, a trusting former colleague could help you move to web development. __This is why your previous work experience is precious: the more people you worked with, the more likely it is that you'll have someone in your direct professionnal network looking for someone they trust.__

I also recommend that you grow your [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/) network as much as possible while working as an employee. All your contacts will be very helpful when you make the switch to freelancing and you need to spread the good news. One of your old colleague might be starting her own business, or know someone who is.

Other networks can also be very useful to make business connections. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/) are two good examples. Network with people who share similar technological expertise or interest. Their network will come in handy when it's time to advertise yourself as a freelance developer.

At this stage, attending meetups and conferences to meet potential clients or fellow freelance developers is not necessary. Because you're not a freelance developer yet, people will have some difficulties understanding how you're positionning yourself. Chances are you don't even know yourself. Even if you were presented with contract opportunites, you would not be able to accept them. At that point your time is best spent nurturing your relationships with your co-workers.

Playing nice with your employer 
----------------------------

In the same idea, I strongly advise that you __help your employer make your departure as painless as possible.__ One way to do this would be to give your notice several months before you plan to actually leave, and to be flexible about the deadline. You want to avoid putting them in a difficult position. Usually, there's no hurry for you to leave, and staying a few weeks or months more than planned can help you save even more money. In the end, if your departure is smooth, senior employees working in your team and starting new businesses that need freelance developers will be more likely to reach out to you.
  
Choosing your skills
------------------------

When working in the same permanent position for a while, you're not always encouraged to adapt your skills to the market. In the context of a big company where technical roles are very separated, being a specialist has a lot of value. The more you know about a few selected subjects the better since your tasks don't change much. On the other hand, generalist programmers working for small companies have an advantage here: they can choose from a broader set of skills. 

In both situations though, _you will have to make choices: you can't be very good at everything.__ Moreover, clients hiring you to work as a contractor will want to see immediate results that are correlated to the amount of money they spend. Where employeers hiring you full-time may want to invest in your development, your clients will want to have an immediate return on investment.

I suggest that you don't put your eggs in the same basket: __choose a small set of skills that is well balanced between mainstream technologies and some "niche" ones.__ By mainstream I mean generic skills like Java, JavaScript (front-end or back-end), databases (SQL and NoSQL), web development, .Net, Python, etc. I recommend that you pick these skills from your previous work experiences: because they are mainstream, the competition is larger than for other skills, and you will need several years of experience to be seen as a good investment by potential clients.

Niche skills, on the other hand, do not necessarily require the same amount of experience because there's less competition. [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), [graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database), Chrome extensions development, Kinect programming, video games profiling and optimization are all examples of rare skills. If you're good at one of them, chances are that potential clients won't require you to have several years of experience. They won't be able to find someone with this experience as easily as for mainstream skills.

The type of contracts you'll get from mainstream and niche skills are usually very different: longer and less paying contracts for mainstream skills, shorter but high paying jobs for niche ones. Having a well balanced set will allow you to alternate between these types of contracts. It will also protect you from technology shifts and rapid changes in demand for a given skills. Also note that a mainstream skill can become niche over time, COBOL programmers could probably tell you a few interesting stories on that.

To me, a well balanced set of skills is composed of two mainstream skills and one niche. Of course, the more the better, but staying up to date on more than three skills can ve very time consuming. My three mainstream skills are back-end web development with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), iOS development annd C++. I also have two niche skills: [Lua](http://www.lua.org/) and advanced debugging of native applications.

Gearing up
----------

To me, __a freelancer is like a craftman and a great craftman needs great tools.__ These come in two categories: hardware and software tools. By definition, hardware is harder to change than software, so I will focus only on the former in this article.

Your clients will need you in their office most of the time. Chances are you'll also want to work at home sometimes: it's handy when you have some paperwork to do during the day and need to go around town, but still need to get some work done. You may also want to work for remote clients. Finally, having the freedom to take a day off during the week and work during the week-end when your client's office is closed is also very nice. In other words, you'll need a laptop.

It's not easy to pick a good laptop if you want to leave your options open. __You won't be able to develop iOS apps on something else than Apple hardware. __This need to be considered since mobile apps development is a market of choice for freelance developers, and iOS is one of the largest players in this industry. If you don't focus on just one skill, the choice can become difficult. What if you'd like to be able to work on iOS apps, develop native applications running on Windows and use your Ubuntu setup for web development? In that case, a high-end mac book pro with lots of RAM and a SSD drive will allow you to host all virtual machines you need and run them reasonnably fast. 

For those not working on iOS applications, I would suggest that you think twice before buying a PC laptop: __unless you don't want to target clients looking for iOS developers, chances are that these kind of projects will come around__ and it would be a shame to have to invest in another computer just to be able to work on Apple's platform.

If you choose to go the Apple way, I invite you to buy a light and small model: a 13 inches macbook pro is ideal to me. At around 4 pounds, it won't put too much strain on your back when carrying it in a back pack on your way to your client's office, or to your favorite caf√©. It's also small enough to fit in small back packs. It has aan ethernet port which is also a must: it can come very handy at offices where they still don't allow contractors to use their Wifi network.

__Don't be afraid to invest in good hardware__, you'll be able to deduct hardware expenses from your income taxes, and you'll be able to get the sales tax back. A 13 inches macbook pro with retina display, 8GBs RAM and a 128 GBs SSD drive currently sells for 1699$, taxes not included. If 128 GBs of storage is a little too tight to store all your data, I invite you to think about using an external USB 3 key before opting for the expensive SSD upgrade to 256 GBs. Anyway, for a maximum of 2000 tax deductible dollars, you should be able to get a great tool that makes coding efficient and pleasurable.

Quick paperwork that can save you money
---------------------------------------

__Paperwork can be very frustrating sometimes, but it can also save you a lot of money!__ One thing that is really easy to setup is registering your sales tax numbers. It provides you with two advantages:
- Tax numbers on your invoices that make you look more professionnal.
- A refund on some of the sales tax that you paid when buying goods that help run your business (computers, software, etc.).

In other words, __it can save you lots of money and prevents your clients to wonder if you're reaully serious about your business.__

If you're a Qu√©bec resident, you can do it online and receive your tax numbers almost instantly. Go to the [GST/HST and QST section](http://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/entreprise/taxes/tvq_tps/default.aspx) of [Revenu Qu√©bec's website](http://www.revenuquebec.ca/) and follow the instructions.

Putting your code online
------------------------

Your code tells a lot about who you are as a programmer. __Potential clients will want to see at least a few hundreds lines of your code and you should be able to provide them with it very quickly.__ The more code you wrote is available publicly the better. 

Of course, you can't publish any code for which you don't have publishing rights. For instance, you can't publish code that you wrote as part of a proprietary software's development effort. This is a good opportunity to start working on personal and open source projects.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) are two great platforms when it comes to hosting, publishing and contributing to code. They are very similar technically speaking and in terms of basic user features, but their purpose is very different. While GitHub is really a social coding platform, Bitbucket is a business friendly code management service in the cloud.

GitHub allows you to have an unlimited number of collaborators, but [you have to pay for private repositories](https://github.com/plans). With Bitbucket, while you can have an unlimited number of repositories (private or public), the [different available plans](https://bitbucket.org/plans) limit the number of people you can collaborate with on a given repository: from 5 collaborators for free to an unlimited number of collaborators for 200$.

Depending on the type of projects you work on, you might need more private repositories, or more collaborators. If you plan to work on open source projects, GitHub is really the platform of choice. On the other hand, if you plan to build proprietary software with a limited number of collaborators, and you need to host your code on the cloud, BitBucket is an excellent solution. Personnally, I use both of them: GitHub when I contribute to open source software, and BitBucket when I work on my personal projects.

Ideally, you should always work on code that you can publish online. At least, you should be able to show it to potential clients, otherwise its value becomes significantly lower.

What you don't actually need to do right now
--------------------------------------------

It is common for aspiring freelance developers to think that they absolutely need to have everything other businesses usually have before they can start getting contracts. Things like a good looking website or an incorporated company can indeed be very useful for established businesses, but it is not necessary for a freelance programmer who is just starting. Worse, it can even cause large additional costs, both in time and money, at a time when these resources can be very scarce.

Building and maintaining your website will take you time that you won't be able to spend on getting contracts. In my experience, potential __clients don't really care if you have a good looking website, as long as your code can be found somewhere.__ For that purpose, there are better solutions than custom websites in the previous section "Putting your code online".

Incorporating your company will cost you money to register it, but also to unregister it. It can be a lot of money spent for nothing if you realize you need to change your business strategy soon after you started. It will also take much more time in paperwork that you will have to offload to an accountant, which will also cost you money. You can spend at least a few years without incorporating your business by declaring yourself as self-employed person. __Unless you make more than 100K$ a year, incorporating your business will not help you in any way.__

This concludes the preparation stage. We covered a lot of ground, so let's summarize what we learned so far. 

To be well prepared for being a successful freelancer, you'll need to do the following:
- Spend a few years as a full-time employee and make contacts who trust you.
- Save money while you are employed so that you don't need to sign a contract in the first few weeks after you left your job.
- Grow your professionnal network on Linkedin and other profesionnal networking platforms.
- Leave your employer respectfully, giving her plenty of time to prepare your departure. It will help you keep a good relationship 
with your old employer and colleagues, which will help you in the long term.
- Choose your skills, ideally two mainstream and one niche.
- Invest in the right hardware to be ready to tackle any challenge for the next three years. An high-end macbook pro is my recommendation.
- Do paperwork that can save you money, like registering your tax numbers, as soon as possible.
- Put your code online so that potential clients can actually see how good it is.

On the contrary, you should _not_ do the following:
 - Build a sofisticated website.
 - Incorporate your business.

With all that in mind, let's move to the next stage where we present what to do after you left your full-time job and before you sign your first contracts.

Transition, or what to do before you sign your first clients
============================================================

At that point in your move to freelancing, you left your full-time job or occupation. Thus, you can advertise yourself as a freelance developer. It's also a time when you generally don't have any contract to work on yet. Because you're ready to work on a project anytime, It is a great opportunity to use that free time to network with potential clients and sign your first contract. 

Leverage social networks to announce your new status
----------------------------------------------------

__It is very important to make your switch from employee to freelance clear to your professional network__. Post on your Linkedin wall, twitter feed and any other network. Make it clear that you're available for contract hire. Mention the skills you chose during your preparation. 

You will also want to avoid receiving messages from recruiters about full-time job opportunities. Make it clear in your profile that you're offering your skills as a contractor, and that you're not looking for a job. 

Attending developer meetups and conferences
-------------------------------------------

__Now that you're officially a freelance developer, it is much easier for your potential clients and your peers to understand how you position yourself.__ It will be much easier for them to see the value you can bring to their business. Other freelance developers will see you as a potential partner or collaborator, and potential clients will know that you're available for contract work. 

Montreal has a lot of events going on all year long where you can meet friendly and talented developers. [Montreal Tech Watch](http://montrealtechwatch.com/) has lots of information about next conferences, meetups and hackathons. I also invite you to subscribe to [their calendar](http://montrealtechwatch.com/2011/11/21/a-complete-calendar-of-montreal-tech-events/) so that you can receive notifications before each event.

Notable events include the [Confoo conference](http://confoo.ca/), [MTL new tech](http://mtlnewtech.tumblr.com/), [Big Data](http://www.bigdatamontreal.org/), [JS Montreal](http://js-montreal.org/), [Montreal.rb](http://www.montrealrb.com/) and [MontrealPython](http://montrealpython.org/) meetups. Some of these events are hosted at the [Notman House](http://notman.org/), which is a hub for people interested in all things related to technology.

Networking with potential clients
---------------------------------

Conferences, meetups and hackathons are great to meet fellow developers, but __some events are even better if you're looking to meet 
potential clients.__ For instance the [AQIII](http://www.aqiii.org/), for "Association Qu√©b√©coise des Informaticiens et Informaticiennes Ind√©pendants", organizes monthly meetups where independent software development consultants can meet potential clients or recruiters. They also run a monthly newsletter with tons of interesting information about all things related to running your personal business like financial or legal tips. You can consult a directory of professionnals offering services to freelance developers, like independent insurance providers, accountants or financial counselors. Being independent themselves, they are more likely to understand your needs. 

Recruiters are also very helpful to contact businesses you wouldn't have access to otherwise. Feel free to connect with them on profesionnal networks like LinkedIn: it's in their interest to connect with you, and they will send you contract opportunities sooner or later. As mentionned earlier, make it very clear that you're a freelance developer and that you're not looking to work as an employee. You should have enough recruiters in your professional network who hire for contract to that you receive contract opportunities that fit your skillset at least once every month or so.

Subscribing to quality job posts websites
-----------------------------------------------

Jobs posting websites can feel old, confusing and targetted exclusively towards full-time employees. Moreover, there is not much variety in the opportunities that are offered in terms of skills and industries. Often, you'll find opportunites for developers with an expertise in established technological stacks, like Java or PHP. __What if you're looking for a part-time freelance gig to work on a cool Node.js back-end using Redis, all of that running on Amazon Web Services?__

Smaller jobs posting platforms exist that have these opportunities. As an added bonus, their user experience is often much better than the other ones. I personnally use [Gun.io](http://gun.io/) and [Authentic Jobs](http://www.authenticjobs.com/), but I'm sure that more exist out there.

Pricing and working schedule
----------------------------

Last but not least, __you will need to plan your working schedule and a pricing strategy before contacting your first potential clients.__ Their first questions will likely be: _"When are you ready to work?"_ and _"How much is it?"_. Usually, they expect your answers to be _"Right now!"_ and _"A small amount of money."_. However, it doesn't have to be that way. 

The important thing here is to make up your mind regarding your availability and pricing _before_ you meet a potential client. During the negotiation, __it will be much easier if you know what you're ready to give up and what you want to stand for than if you improvise on the spot.__

The questions you'll have to answer for yourself are:

- _Do I want to be paid by the hour or by projects?_ __Unless you're an expert with a few projects under your belt using a very similar technology and solving very similar problems, I recommend that you charge by the hour.__ Otherwise, you may end up working extra hours for nothing. It has also a lot of advantages for your client: if the project goes out of hand, or does not make sense for your client business anymore at some point in time, it can be cancelled very quickly without incurring any significant cost. If the project is executed quicker than expected, your client doesn't have to pay you for hours not worked. More generally, it's easier both for you and your client to stay agile when you're paid by the hour.

- _How much do I charge?_ Weither you charge by the hour or by project, __you should not price your work too low, or you will end up burned out and your work will suffer.__ In the end, your clients will end up not satisfied and nobody wins. In Montreal, a fair price can range from about 65$/hour to around 150$/hour, depending on the type of work and your expertise. Since you just started freelancing, chances are that your price will lean towards the lower end. However, don't hesitate to charge what you feel is fair for your work: your potential clients will not accept it if it's not in their price range, and that's fine. Not getting a contract because your price is too high happens all the time. Other potential clients who are willing to pay the price for the value they get from your work will come around. Of course, it doesn't mean overpricing your work. unless you're truly an expert in your field, charging more than 100$/hour may not be a good idea.

- _How long do I work?_ This question is actually two questions in one: _"How long do I work during the week?"_, and _"How long am I ready to work for a given contract?"_ __Moving to freelancing is also a lifestyle choice.__ You are free to choose how long you want to work and the answer doesn't have to be 40 hours a week every day for an unlimited amount of time. In the end, you should ask yourself what makes you most efficient for your clients, and what is compatible with your lifestyle. 
Personally, I enjoy working 40 hours/week and 5 days a week for periods of three months. This allows me to be efficient and get enough work done in a week to feel motivated by my progress. It also prevents me from getting bored and it helps me pick small sized projects that last for about three months before they're done or they move to the next stage. I tried other types of schedules, like 3 days/week of 8 hours each, but I found out I was still thinking about my client's project the rest of the week. I also ahd the feeling that I wasn't progressing as fast as I could.
You should try a schedule that you think is good for you. Don't overthink this, pick a schedule, and see how it works. You should be able to communicate to your client if the schedule you picked doesn't work as expected. 

- How many clients do I work for at the same time? __A common mistake is to think that you have the time to work for more than one client if it fits in your schedule.__ I would strongly advise against it unless each client's project takes one third of your weekly schedule or less (e.g slightly less than two days for a 5 days/week schedule). The reason is that a lot of unforeseen events and difficulties can happen during a software development project. Each project will likely take more of your time than expected, turning your 3 days/week schedule into a 5 days/week one, or your 5 days/week schedule into a nightmare. Instead, I recommend working for one client at a time, setting your price accordingly and using your free time to develop your skills.

Execution, or how to keep your business on track
================================================

All this effort has hopefully paid, and you managed to get your first contract, congratulations! It is now time to give your best to your clients and keep your business healthy.

Picking your workplace
----------------------

__Your workplace can make a big difference on how you feel about your work.__ You should consider your options carefully before accepting contracts. 

You will often need to work at your client's office. It's generally the best way to collaborate with your client's team. Unfortunately, in this case you don't get to choose your workplace. For this reason, if your potential client requires you to work on site, you should visit their office and make sure it won't have a negative impact on you.
If in doubt, express your concerns and take some time to think about it. A compromise can sometimes be reached where you can spend most of the time working off site, and visit your client when needed. As with price negotiations, if your potential client's workplace doesn't meet your standards and you're not allowed to work from outside, there's no obligation to accept the contract.

If you're free to pick where you work from, you generally have two options: work from home or find a working space. Working from home sometimes represents the ideal of working in the cosy comfort of your house, the tranquility needed to focus on your code and the ability to eat and drink healthy. While this is true to some extent, always working from home is not without drawbacks. 

First, __it's very easy to isolate yourself from your peers and your social network__. Going out of your home forces you to have social interactions that make you grow as a developer and as a person. Comments on your code from fellow developers, pieces of advices about software design around a cup of coffee, or tales of vacations at the other end of the world can all inspire you and will keep you moving. Working _and_ living at home can also give you the feeling that you're always working, which in turn can lead to burn out.

Luckily, there's plenty of options to find a working space in Montreal. One of them is called [co-working](http://wiki.coworking.com/). The idea of a co-working space is simple: a large office equipped with all business facilities (internet connection, printers, desks, meeting rooms, etc.) is rented by freelancers and/or small companies. All members share a part of the rent and have access to the space as they want. Usually, co-working spaces have lots of plans that allow you to rent a desk part time. This is a good solution if you want to cut the cost and work from your quiet home from time to time. Montreal has lots of co-working spaces but it is not easy to find a regularly updated online directory. The co-working wiki has [a list of spaces available in Montreal](http://wiki.coworking.com/w/page-revisions/16583617/CoworkingMontreal), but some of its content is a bit outdated. You'll need to double-check the information on each space's website and use other resources to have a more complete picture what Montreal has to offer in terms of co-working spaces.

To help you in your choice, here's a list of some of the co-working spaces I know or heard of:
- [Station C](http://www.station-c.com/): one of the oldest, located in the heart of the Mile-End. Previously located on Boulevard St-Laurent, it has recentely moved on Rue de Gasp√©. It's close to the Laurier metro station, and surrounded by great caf√©s and restaurants. They have a 3 days/week plan with unlimited nights and week-ends. At 175$/month, it's a good balance between working at home and renting a space full-time.
- [Ecto](http://ecto.coop/): a co-working space that encourages co-operation between its members. It is located in the heart of the Plateau close to the orane line (Sherbrooke and Mont-Royal metro stations).
- [Exeko](http://exeko.org/): located close to the Station C on rue de Gasp√© in the heart of the Mile-End, it's a small but charming space where members of the Exeko organization share their space with freelancers of various backgrounds. Their website doesn't mention their co-working space anymore, so you should double check with them if they still welcome external freelancers.
- [Notman House](http://notman.org/): a hub for Montreal's technology scene, it hosts numerous events like hackathons and conferences. It also has a co-working space and private spaces for start-ups. Prices are not available on their website, and you'll need to use Chrome to be able to view their website's content correctly. Being a central place for Montreal's tech scene, it can be a great space if you want to network with interesting people.

Most of co-working spaces offer a one-day free trial, so don't be afraid to try them before making your decision.

Accounting and invoicing solutions 
----------------------------------

Eventually, you will need to make money to make your freelance business sustainable. That means tracking time spent working and sending invoices to your clients. Depending on your contracts, you may also need help in accounting to keep track of your expenses and revenue.

Plenty of solutions exist to take care of these two aspects of your business. Some of them provide accounting and invoicing services, other only offer one or the other. To me, unless your revenue and expense workflow is complicated (lots of different clients, large amount of expenses that you sometimes bill to your clients, etc.), __a beginner freelancer should only need an invoicing solution, not the accounting part.__

You will also need to check their pricing plan to understand which one is most adapted to your needs. Some of them base their price 
on the number of clients that you have, others on the number of collaborators or invoices you can send, and some are totally free.

I started using [Freshbooks](http://freshbooks.com/), a two in one solution. It's great for invoicing. It's easy to use, generates good looking invoices that can be translated with a click of a button, and interfaces with lots of payment options like [Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/) and [Paypal](http://paypal.ca/). While I was very happy with the results, I felt that 20.95$/month for generating invoices was a bit expensive.

I looked for cheaper alternatives and one of my fellow developers [@jfstgermain](https://twitter.com/jfstgermain) recommended [Harvest](http://www.getharvest.com/) to me. At $12/month, it is significantly cheaper. While the time tracking and invoicing features are good enough for my use cases, it can sometimes feel a bit bare. For instance, you'll have to handle translating invoices yourself. In a bilingual and multicultural area such as Montreal, it can be a deal breaker. So far, all my clients have been happy to receive invoices written in english, but it may change in the future.

Many more solutions exist out here. [Invoice machine](http://invoicemachine.com/) looks like an interesting minimal solution that is free for freelancers who are not sending more than 3 invoices per month, which is realistic for a software developer. [Waveapps](https://www.waveapps.com/) is completely free and seems to provide a complete business platform. I encourage you to look around and use what is best adapted to your needs.

Taxes
-----

Declaring and paying taxes is mandatory, and it can become very time consuming and confusing if not taken seriously. Luckily, it is also quick and easy if you update your records regularly. When you make a transaction that has some impact on your taxes, record it in your files immediately. For instance, if you buy a piece of software, record the transaction as soon as your receive the assiocated invoice. I suggest using [Google spreadsheets](https://spreadsheets.google.com/) to keep track of the numbers, and saving your electronic invoices in the cloud. Remember that you are required by the [Quebec revenue agency](http://www.revenuquebec.ca/) to be able to present data up to 7 years old. For paper invoices, you can take a picture and upload it to the same cloud service.

Following this process, and if you use an invoicing solution as mentionned in the previous section, doing your taxes shouldn't take more than 30 minutes at the end of the year: you'll just need to open them and sum everything up to produce your tax declaration.

To actually produce your tax declaration, you can either pay an accountant or do it yourself using software solutions like ImpotExpert.
Accounting expenses are deductible from your taxes, so the additional cost is not too high. Moreover, accountants can often optimized your tax declaration so that you can get more money back. However, producing your tax declaration yourself gives you a lot of hindsight of where your hard earned money is going.

If you'd like to use an accountant's services, I personnally have always been satisfied with [Impots-Ici](http://www.impots-ici.com/). Otherwise, [UFile](http://www.drtax.ca/en/UFile.aspx) (or [ImpotExpert](http://www.drtax.ca/fr/ImpotExpert.aspx) in French) is a very simple, affordable and complete solution. Most accountants actually use it to produce tax declarations.

Insurance 
---------

One of the perks of being employed by a company is to automatically benefit from a good health and salary insurance. As soon as you start becoming a freelancer, these two protections are not automatic. You will need to subscribe to health and salary (separately most of the time) insurance yourself. In order to do that, you can contact insurance brokers. Some of them, like [SFL](https://www.dfsinvestmentinsurance.ca/) or [SFITA](www.sfita.ca/) are independent insurance consultants. Being independent professionals like yourself, they should better understand your needs. Personnally, I contacted SFL and subscribed to health and salary insurance with them and I'm very happy so far with the service. I invite you to contact them and they'll be happy to answer your questions for free. 

Training
--------

Keeping your software development skills up to date is key to your success. You will regularly need to improve one or several of the skills you chose to focus on (see "Choosing your skills" in the first section). You will also need to acquire new skills you identified as essential to maintain or grow your business. 

Fortunately, lots of resources are available to software developers for self-improvement. Blogs, forums and answer sites like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) are great to find out answers to specific technical questions. Twitter feeds are also very helpful to learn about emerging technologies and paradigms. These resources are free most of the time and it will only cost you some time to find and use the best ones. 

However, I'm a strong believer in training by doing. I think that the best way to learn about something is to struggle with it. For this reason I recommend that you don't spend too much time reading. Choose a small set of excellent resources that you select and update regularly. The goal is to spend a small amount of time reading instead of doing any actual work. You should not spend more than thirty minutes a day reading about technology unless you're acquiring a new skill. 

Fellow programmers will also be available during meetups, hackathons and conferences to share their knowledge with you. Montreal has excellent events going on all year long. My favorites include JS Montreal meetups and the Confoo conference, but you can find many more by subscribing to the [Montreal Tech Events calendar](http://montrealtechwatch.com/2011/11/21/a-complete-calendar-of-montreal-tech-events/), or by visiting the excellent [Montreal Tech Watch](http://montrealtechwatch.com/).

Meetups and hackathons are generally free, but conferences can be expensive. Most of them also happens during the week, and if you're a successful software developer, chances are that you'll have to choose between attending an expensive conference or billing your clients. For this reason, you should carefully ask yourself: _"What value can I get out of this conference?"_. If the answer is not a clear return on investment, I recommend you to wait for a better opportunity. 

Finally, if you're looking for a comprehensive resource on a specific subject to use as a reference or training material, a great book can be a very helpful companion. However books can be expensive, take a lot of room on your shelves and you don't even need them all the time. [Safari Books Online](http://www.safaribooksonline.com/), from [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com/), is a large tech books library available from 29.99$/month. You can access up to 10 books during a month, and you can even download some of them for offline reading. Most of the O'Reilly collection is available, plus lots of other editors' publications. The quality is very good and the catalog is updated regularly. They also offer video tutorials, master classes and conferences. Another plan is also available at 44.99$/month and gives you access to early drafts, which can help you get into a new technology before your competitors. If you're on a budget, the [Biblioth√®que et Archives Nationales](http://www.banq.qc.ca/) du Qu√©bec has a Safari account that gives you access to the Safari catalog if you're a member of the library.
