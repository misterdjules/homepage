CoffeeScript became one of my day-to-day programming languages five months ago, when a client decided to use it instead of JavaScript to build the Node.js backend for a very ambitious cloud platform. The opportunity to use a language I had heard a lot of interesting things about, like its concise syntax and clearer semantics, thrilled me. However, my skills needed to get up to speed quickly.

In that situation, my preference is for shorts book that I can read cover to cover in a couple of weeks. A theoritically sound presentation of basics and a selection of best practices is most important. I try to avoid books with more than 350 pages other than for reference material. Once I feel that I'm on the right track, I try to learn by experimenting and reading other seasoned programmers' code.

Some of [the author](https://twitter.com/raganwald)'s work - a sample of the now freely available [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read) and some of [his essays](http://raganwald.com/) - had already caught my attention when I was looking for an advanced JavaScript book. __His theoritical rigor and the fact that his books seemed to be short and to the point impressed me.__ When it was time to get started with CoffeeScript, I decided to give his "CoffeeScript Ristretto" a try.

My first impressions were not very good. Although the author explicitely warns the reader about it at the very beginning, __the content in the first chapters felt too basic. Unfortunately, it is not until the second half of the text that things start to really take off.__ Basic concepts like the difference between values and expressions are discussed lenghtly. It allows for interesting theoritical reflections - like in the essay about the tension between encapsulation and extension in object oriented programming - but sometimes it can be very boring. __It seems that the author wanted to target absolute beginners and advanced programmers at the same time.__

The writing style sometimes feel too verbose, or even on the border of being pedantic. At other times, the theoritical rigor mixed with a strong sense of humour can be very refreshing. There's even a reference to [the argument sketch from the Monty Pythons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y).

__In other words, this is a work full of contrasts where the brilliant shines alongside the average.__

Example code is almost always very academic and sometimes a bit convoluted. A better balance between practical and theoritical examples would have been welcome. It is not a big issue in itself, but it makes the text less captivating or more difficult to read, especially towards the end of the book where concepts are more advanced. Fortunately, illustrations related to coffee (the beverage, not the language) provide for a welcome breadth of fresh hair between dense sections.

__The book also suffers of a lack of diagrams__, especially when presenting some concepts that can easily be represented graphically like closures. The order of chapters is also surprising sometimes: I still wonder why the one about how to run examples is at the end of the book.

__Despite all these little shortcomings, I really loved this book.__ I also know that I will get back to it more than once. It is indeed filled with interesting digressions that mention concepts from advanced or lesser known mathematic and computer science concepts like [fixed point combinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator). The theoritical rigor with which fundamental concepts are presented makes it a solid text to better understand some core programming concepts.

At the end of the day, _CoffeeScript Ristretto_ was not the book I expected to read. It may not be the best edited book, and it is not the quickest way to learn what makes CoffeeScript unique. However, __with a high theoritical level and inspirational digressions, it is a very enlightning text that will benefit any programmer and will leave you thinking about interesting programming concepts long after you closed it.__ At 15 dollars, It is a bargain to me.
