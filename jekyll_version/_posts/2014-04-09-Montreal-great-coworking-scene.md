I recently completed a contract for one of my clients and I decided to work on personal business projects for a few months. In order to break the isolation of working from home, I looked for a space where I could work efficiently and meet other like-minded people. In this post, I want to share with you why I think Montreal has great co-working scene.

What's co-working
=================

[Co-working](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) is a simple idea: a group of people shares the costs of the same working space while not necessarily working together. It's not a new concept, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking), the term "co-working" was first used by Brad Neuberg in 2005 "to describe a physical space which he originally called a 9 to 5 group". Since then, hundreds of co-working spaces have been created around the globe and it's common to find [at least several spaces in any major city](http://www.coworkingcanada.ca/spaces/).

Why it's useful for freelance developers
========================================

Freelance developers, unless they work on-site for their client, often face the difficult choice of either working from home or finding an office space.

I already talked about the caveats of working from home in the [third part](/2013/08/13/A-few-tips-for-new-freelance-developers-in-montreal-part-3/) of [my series of tips for freelance developers in Montreal](/tags.html#freelance_in_montreal_series-ref). It works very well for some, but it can lead to isolation and a significant drop in productivity for others.

Finding a work space on your own, on the other hand, can become a problem. First, it can be quite expensive, especially in a city where housing is becoming more and more expensive. Second, it usually means you have to commit yourself for one year or more. This is a risk for many freelance developers who don't have more than a few months outlook on their business activities.

This is where co-working comes into play: it allows for the same flexibility of working from home, and it prevents isolation.

Montreal's offer
================

Montrealers are lucky to have many excellent co-working spaces to choose from: [Station C](http://www.station-c.com/), [ECTO](http://www.ecto.coop/), [Nexus](http://www.nexusmontreal.com/), [Notman House](http://notman.org/), [Espace 360](http://www.espace-360.com/), [Ideal](http://idealcoworking.blogspot.ca/) and [more](http://www.coworkingcanada.ca/spaces/).

Most co-working spaces are located in the east of Montreal, except for [Ideal](http://idealcoworking.blogspot.ca/) located near Lionel-Groulx metro and [Notman House](http://notman.org/) located near Place des Arts. However, some new spaces are also being created, like [a new space in Verdun](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Espace-Coworking-Verdun/801817573169120) that may be ready in 2015.

Although all spaces have a similar offer, with pricing plans that vary only slightly, the joy is in the details. Most co-working spaces offer a one or two days trial. This is a great way to actually spend a day of work on-site, meet other co-workers who know more about the space, and see what works best for you.

A short review of three co-working spaces
---------------------------------------

I personally tried three different spaces: [Station C](http://www.station-c.com/), [ECTO](http://www.ecto.coop/) and [Nexus](http://www.nexusmontreal.com/). All of them have been very helpful to help me find the space that works best for my needs. Below is a short review of each of them.

### Station C

[Station C](http://www.station-c.com/) is located in the Mile-end, a block away from Saint-Laurent and St-Viateur. There's a lot of good restaurants and cafés in the area, which is handy for more informal meetings with clients or collaborators. [Café Falco](http://www.cafefalco.ca/), a great Japanese café and restaurant, is even in the same building.

The space is very modern and new, with very comfortable chairs and nice wooden desks. There's also a fully equipped kitchen and a nice lounge with comfortable sofas to relax on.

Justine welcomed me at the beginning of the trial day, and she was most helpful in making me feel comfortable and productive. Everybody there was very respectful and it was easy to focus on work even without headphones.

### Nexus

Nexus is located in the heart of the Plateau area, just one block away from Saint-Laurent at the corner of Mont-Royal. It's very close to Mount-Royal park, a big grocery store and many good restaurants and cafés. It is the home of [Noesis Innovation](http://www.noesisinnovation.net/Home). They share the remaining space to freelancers and other small businesses. I was welcomed by Sylvain, Noesis' co-founder, who was very also very accomodating in helping me feel at home.

Although Nexus is almost certainly the cheapest of all co-working spaces in Montreal at 219$ + tax for unlimited access, desks and chairs are of very good quality, and you can even use a book shelf to store your stuff. In addition to the small companies sharing Nexus' co-working spaces, there's many other small dynamic business in the building, adding to the feeling of a community of startups.

### ECTO

ECTO is a bit different than other co-working spaces. It's built as a co-op where every co-worker is a member. 
To become a member, a minimum fee of 350$ is required, which is tax-deductible. There's a real feeling of community. Pot-lucks happen every Thursday where every one who wants to join brings some ingredients and helps preparing lunch. Meeting new people is also very quick when having lunch at the commomn table every other day of the week.

The space itself is very warm and welcoming, with lots light, plants and a nice design. Spanning two floors, it's bigger than most other spaces with several big meeting rooms, small soundproof cabins to make phone calls, and even a lounge that allows groups of people to be a bit louder without disturbing other co-workers.

It is close to Lafontaine park, Sherbrooke metro and some good restaurants and cafés. There's even a small park right in front of the building with picnic tables and chairs. Sandra, one of the space's coordinators, was very helpful and made it very easy to feel part of the community.

Try it for yourself!

Freelancers and small business are lucky to find in Montreal a lot of high quality and welcoming co-working spaces to choose from. Try them for yourself and let me know in the comments what you think!
