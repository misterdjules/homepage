After having completed a one year contract for one of my clients, it was time to work on some personal business projects for a few months. In order to break the isolation of working from home, I started looking for a space where I could work efficiently and meet other like-minded people. In this post, I want to share with you why I chose coworking and give you some insights in Montreal's great coworking scene.

What's coworking
=================

[Coworking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) is a simple idea: a group of people shares the costs of the same working space while not necessarily working together. It's not a new concept, according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking), the term "coworking" was first used by Brad Neuberg in 2005 "to describe a physical space which he originally called a 9 to 5 group". Since then, hundreds of coworking spaces have been created around the globe and it's common to find [at least several spaces in any major city](http://www.coworkingcanada.ca/spaces/).

Why it's useful for freelance developers
========================================

Freelance developers, unless they work on-site for their client, often face the difficult choice of either working from home or finding an office space.

I already talked about the caveats of working from home in the [third part](/2013/08/13/A-few-tips-for-new-freelance-developers-in-montreal-part-3/) of [my series of tips for freelance developers in Montreal](/tags.html#freelance_in_montreal_series-ref). It works very well for some, but for others, it can lead to isolation and a significant drop in productivity.

Finding a work space on your own, on the other hand, can become a problem. It usually means you have to commit yourself for one year or more. This is a risk for many freelance developers who often don't have more than a few months prospect on their business activities.

This is where coworking comes into play: it allows for the same flexibility of working from home, and it prevents isolation.

Montreal's offer
================

Montrealers are lucky to have many excellent coworking spaces to choose from: [Station C](http://www.station-c.com/), [ECTO](http://www.ecto.coop/), [Nexus](http://www.nexusmontreal.com/), [Espace 360](http://www.espace-360.com/) and [more](http://www.coworkingcanada.ca/spaces/).

Most coworking spaces are located in the east of Montreal, except for [Ideal](http://idealcoworking.blogspot.ca/) located near Lionel-Groulx metro and [Notman House](http://notman.org/) found close to Place des Arts. However, some new spaces are also being created, like [a new space in Verdun](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Espace-Coworking-Verdun/801817573169120) that might be ready in 2015.

Most spaces have a similar offer in terms of price and accessiblity. Pricing plans vary only slightly and are usually between 175$ for limited access and 350$ for unlimited access. Most of them offer a one or two days trial. This is a great way to actually spend a day of work on-site, meet other coworkers who know more about the space, and see what works best for you.

A short review of three coworking spaces
---------------------------------------

I personally tried three different spaces: [Station C](http://www.station-c.com/), [ECTO](http://www.ecto.coop/) and [Nexus](http://www.nexusmontreal.com/). All of them have been very prompt to respond to all my inquiries and very helpful in helping me find the space that works best for my needs. Below is a short review of each of them.

### Station C

[Station C](http://www.station-c.com/) is located in the Mile-end, a block away from Saint-Laurent and St-Viateur. There's a lot of good restaurants and cafés in the area, which is handy for more informal meetings with clients or collaborators. [Café Falco](http://www.cafefalco.ca/), a great Japanese café and restaurant, is even in the same building.

The space is very modern and new, with very comfortable chairs and nice wooden desks. There's also a fully equipped kitchen and a nice lounge with comfortable sofas to relax on.

Justine welcomed me at the beginning of the trial day, and she was most helpful in making me feel comfortable and productive. Everybody there was very respectful and it was easy to focus on work even without headphones.

### Nexus

[Nexus](http://www.nexusmontreal.com/) is located in the heart of the Plateau area, just one block away from Saint-Laurent at the corner of Mont-Royal. It's very close to Mount-Royal park, a big grocery store and many good restaurants and cafés. It is the home of [Noesis Innovation](http://www.noesisinnovation.net/Home). They share the remaining space with freelancers and other small businesses. I was welcomed by Sylvain, Noesis' co-founder, who was very also very accomodating in helping me feel at home.

[Nexus](http://www.nexusmontreal.com/) is almost certainly the most affordable of all coworking spaces in Montreal at 219$ + tax for unlimited access. Desks and chairs are of very good quality, and you can even use a book shelf to store your stuff. The space comes with two meeting rooms, a small kitchen with a couple of tables and a comfortable waiting room for your appointments.

In addition to the small companies sharing Nexus' coworking spaces, there are many other small dynamic businesses in the building, adding to the feeling of a community of startups.

### ECTO

[ECTO](http://www.ecto.coop/) is a bit different than other coworking spaces. It's built as a co-op where every coworker is a member. To become a member, a minimum fee of 350$ is required, which is tax-deductible. There's a real feeling of community. People meet and exchange naturally when having lunch at the big kitchen's table every day of the week. Members can also suggest and/or drive changes to how the space and the organization works. Current projects include having a muffins basket or improving the way meeting rooms are booked.

The space itself is very warm and welcoming, with lots of light, plants and a nice design. Spanning two floors, it's bigger than most other spaces with several big meeting rooms, small soundproof cabins to make phone calls, and even a lounge that allows groups of people to relax without disturbing other coworkers. Sofas are also available on both floors to work more comfortably or to take a break. The kitchen is really big and fully equipped, which is very helpful every Thursday for the weekly potluck.

It is close to Lafontaine park, Sherbrooke metro and some good restaurants and cafés. There's even a small park right in front of the building with picnic tables and chairs. Sandra, one of the space's coordinators, was very helpful and made it very easy to feel part of the community.

Try it for yourself!
====================

Freelancers and small business are lucky to find in Montreal a lot of high quality and welcoming coworking spaces to choose from. Even though most coworking space have a similar base offer, the joy is in the details. Try them for yourself and let me know in the comments what you think!
