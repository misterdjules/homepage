One year ago, I left my full-time job at Ubisoft Montreal and embarked on a journey to become a freelance developer. In this article, I share my experience and a few concrete tips that may help you start yours. This article is, of course, targeted towards aspiring freelance programmers, but other freelance workers will hopefully also find a lot to learn and to relate to.

This article is composed of three sections. Each section covers a stage of your progress towards your goal of becoming a freelance developer. They are presented in a chronological order: first the preparation stage, then the transition between your previous occupation and freelancing, and finally the stage at which you're working on your first contracts.

A career is something very personal, and it is very likely that you have different views about what becoming a freelance developer means than mine. This document is not about answering all questions to everyone. It's about sharing my experience with other newcomers so that they can benefit from it, however they like. If you have any question or remark, please share them in the comments at the bottom of this page.

With that in mind, let's start our journey with the first stage: getting prepared to become a freelance developer.

Preparation, or how to put the odds on your side
================================================

It can seem very obvious, but it is very important to be well prepared. A good preparation will buy you more time so you don't have to 
find a client in your first few weeks. It will also allow you to fail a few times before generating a steady income. 
We will go through the topics that I find most important during your preparation, and we'll conclude by mentionning what you might think you need to do, but actually don't.

Building up your experience and profesionnal network with full-time jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This can seem contradictory to the purpose of this article but, to my opinion, spending some time at full-time positions is a great way to achieve three of the most important steps of your preparation: saving money, making contacts and questionning your skills. 

Working as a full-time or part-time employee generally gives you a steady income that can help you save money regularly. It also gives you access to two very valuable resources: real-world projects and co-workers. Real-world projects are great to sharpen and acquire skills. They also help you give a value to them. It will be important when you have to decide which skills you want to focus on. Co-workers are also a great source of knowledge, inspiration, and constitute the base of your professional network.

Acquiring significant real-world experience and building a substantial professional network takes time. I would suggest working at least for two different companies and spending a minimun of two years at each of them before making the move to freelancing. I had worked at four different companies for a total of nine years before embracing freelance development. To me it was the good timing, but others could thing it's too late or too early.

Saving money
------------

Saving money, by working full-time or by any other mean, is key. Once you start positioning yourself as a freelance developer, it could be a while before you sign your first contract. It usually takes even longer before you can cash-in your first check. In this situation, it's not always easy to relax and focus on training, networking, finding clients or building your portfolio. I would recommend a buffer of one year: today, the demand for developers is high, and you should find your first contract pretty quickly if your skills are up to date. However, if you find that your offer is not in tune with the market, it could take a while before you get back on track. The amount of money you'll need to save will depend on your lifestyle. In Montreal, where the cost of living is low comparing to other major cities in North America, 15K$ is enough, it can be higher in other cities.

Making contacts
----------------

Playing nice with your employer 
----------------------------

Help your employer make your departure as painless as possible:
  - Several months notice.
  - Be flexible on the deadline.

Questioning your skills
------------------------

- Make sure your skillset can be sold to potential clients and is well balanced: a mix of mainstream technologies (Java, JavaScript), and possibly some that are more "niche" (Lua, Kinect, etc.).

Gearing up
----------
- What type of development do you plan to do for your clients?
- Getting the right hardware: laptop or desktop ? -> laptop for remote work + clients that don't provide you with a computer, apple or PC ? -> apple + virtual machines. Lots of ram for virtual machines (8 GBs).

Quick paperwork that can save you money
---------------------------------------

- Registering your tax numbers: it helps save some money when buying computer hardware.

Putting your code online
------------------------

- Putting your code online: GitHub or BitBucket? -> BitBucket for unlimited private repositories. Clients will want to see your code.

What you don't actually need to do right now
--------------------------------------------

- A website: recruiters and companies don't look for it, unless your a front-end web developer. 
- Incorporating your business. This is really useful if your revenue is greater than 100K dollars, otherwise it's too costly. 

Transition, or what to do before you sign your first clients
============================================================

Leverage social networks to announce your new status
----------------------------------------------------

Attending developer meetups and conferences
-------------------------------------------

Networking with potential clients: AQII, MTLNewTech, MTL Tech Calendar
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Sharpen your skillset by working on personal projects and code that you can publish. You should work only on code 
that you can publish online, or at least show to potential clients, otherwise it reduces its value significantly.
- Update your LinkedIn account and make it easy for recruiters to find you: make your title clear, actively connect with local recruitment companies, add your skills and describe your past experiences using easy to search keywords.

Execution, or how to keep your business on track
================================================

Accounting and invoicing solutions 
----------------------------------

Harvest vs Freshbooks : Harvest because it's cheaper and it's almost equivalent for beginners. Also mention other solutions https://www.waveapps.com/.

Training
--------

- Self training: safari books online + local conferences + blogs.

Taxes
-----

- Doing taxes yourself: less expensive, highly informative and easy.
- Keeping your expenses and tax records up to date at every transaction: helps a lot to make the process really smooth at the 
end of the quarter/year.
- Store receipts electronically on the cloud, take pictures of them using your phone.

Insurance
---------

- Health and salary insurance: talk to independent providers like SFL.
