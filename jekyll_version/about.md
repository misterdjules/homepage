# Hi!

My name is Julien Gilli, and I'm a freelance software developer who lives in Montreal, Canada.
I am passionate about programming, computer science, soccer and music.

Before becoming a freelance developer in June 2012, I have worked as a software developer for eight years in many different industries,
in France and in Canada. You can find more details about [my profesional experience on my LinkedIn Page](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/jgilli).
I also like to build software on my spare time, and you can find out more about them on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/misterdjules).
When I'm not too busy working on my clients' and personal projects, or learning how to play the piano, I like to [blog](/blog.html)
and [tweet](https://twitter.com/misterdjules) about what got me excited lately.
